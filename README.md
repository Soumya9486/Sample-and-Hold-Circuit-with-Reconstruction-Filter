# Sample-and-Hold Circuit and Reconstruction Filter

## Overview

This repository presents the design and analysis of a sample-and-hold circuit and a reconstruction filter. The project demonstrates the principles of signal sampling and reconstruction, providing a comprehensive guide through detailed schematics, simulations, and documentation.

## Project Structure

- `Schematics/` - Contains the circuit diagrams used for the sample-and-hold and reconstruction stages.
- `Simulations/` - Includes simulation results that illustrate the performance of the circuits.
- `Documentation/` - Detailed explanations of the design process, component selection, and theoretical background.

## Usage

To explore the design and results:

1. Navigate to the `Schematics/` folder to view the circuit designs.
2. Check the `Simulations/` folder for performance analysis and results.
3. Read the `Documentation/` folder for a thorough understanding of the circuit's operation and design considerations.
